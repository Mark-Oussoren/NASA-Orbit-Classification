# NASA-Orbit-Classification - Read!

This repo was meant to serve as a project based on the Kaggle repo. However, the problem is ill-defined and meaningless. Essentially the data was not collected well - the gatherer missed several asteroids that should have been included in the query from NASA's page. The biggest problem is that the problem is solved and there is a deterministic rule based on the features for determining the class of asteroid. That is, NASA defines asteroids by their orbit and has criterions - these criterions are not stochastic and so our work leads to nothing meaningful. I do not recommend trying this Kaggle challenge here: https://www.kaggle.com/brsdincer/orbitclassification
